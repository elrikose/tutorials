# Simple Storage Service (S3)

Infintitely Scaling Storage is one of the most popular AWS services.

# Buckets

Buckets (repositories)
Objects (files)

## Naming

Must have globally unique name defined at region level.

- No uppercase
- No underscore
- 63 char max
- not an IP address
- must start with a lowercase letter or a number

## Objects

Objects must have a key that is the full path. Example keys/paths:

  file.txt
  folder1/folder2/file.txt

The key can b broked down into prefix + object name:

  prefix = folder1/folder2/
  object name = file.txt

Objects are the contents of the files
- Max size is 5 TB
- Can't upload more than 5 GB.
- Files larger than 5GB must be uploaded as a multi-part upload

Objects can have **metadata** that is key/value pairs.

Objects can have **tags** for security or lifecycle management.

Objects can be versioned if enabled.

# Versioning

Objects can be versioned at the bucket level.

Every time the object is updated it will change. Hashes.
- Protected from overwrites
- Easy to roll back

Things to Remember:
- Any non versioned object will be null
- Suspending versioning will not delete previous versions.
- Objects that have been deleted have a delete marker

# Encryption

There are 4 methods of encrypting objects

SSE = Server Side Encryption

- SSE-S3 - Keys managed by S3
- SSE-KMS - Use Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
- SSE-C - Managed by the user
- Client Side Encryption

## SSE-S3

- Server-side encryption
- AES-256
- Must set header to:  x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256

HTTPS + Header upload of object will encrypt into the bucket

## SSE-KMS

- Server-side encryption
- user control + audit trail
- Must set header to:  x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms

## SSE-C

- Server-side encryption
- Amazon doesn't store the encryption key
- Must use HTTPS (mandatory)
- Encryption key must be in the headers

HTTPS + Data key in header. AWS doesn't persist key

## Client Side Encryption

Use client libraries suce has Amazon S3 Encryption Client

- Clients must encrypt/decrypt before sending/retrieving.
- Customer manages all of the keys

## SSL

Amazon S3 supports both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints

# S3 Security Policies

JSON based policies for access for buckets and objects

Policies include:
- Allow and Deny access
- Account or user to apply policy to

Used for:
- Public access to a bucket
- Force object to be encrypted
- Grant access

Settings for Block Public Access
- New ACLs
- Any ACLs
- New public bucket or access point

Networking
- Supports VPC Endpoints

Logging and Audit
- S3 Access logs can be stored in other S3 buckets
- API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail

User Security
- MFA required for delete in versioned buckets
- Expired URLs

# S3 Websites

Can host static websites. Can be accessible with

- < bucket-name >.s3-website-< region >.amazonaws.com
- < bucket-name >.s3-website.< region >.amazonaws.com

If you get a 403, that is a bucket policy that doesn't allow for public access.

# Cross Origin Region Sharing (CORS)

An origin is a protocol, domain, and port. If you need to access another origin and it only wants to deliver it from the first origin, you have to add to the header (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and then it will provide it to the user. Otherwise it will error out.

S3 buckets works similarly because of S3 Websites. It is a way to block websites from referrring to your static assets unless there is a CORS policy

# Consistency Model

Any time you put or overwrite an object in a bucket, the next read will now be consistent for reading or listing. Thise didn't use to be the case.
